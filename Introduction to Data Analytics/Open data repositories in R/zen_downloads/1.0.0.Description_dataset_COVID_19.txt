DATASET fields:
"Country" :
	Country name; 37 European countries included.

"Date": 
	Date stamp at the collection time.
	Data collection was performed in the last day of every month. 
	Date format: YYYY-MM-DD

"Month_Key" : 
	Date stamp at the collection time, formatted for easier monthly time series analysis.
	Date format: YYYY-MM

"Month_Fct2020"
	Date stamp at the collection time,formatted for easier graphing, as a string with names of the months
	(in English). 

"Deaths_per_1Mpop" :
	Monthly mortality from COVID-19 raported in the country, 
	reported as number of COVID-19 deaths per 1 million population of the country, 
	in that particular month / country. 
	NB: it is reported as million population, not patients. 

"LogDeaths_per_1Mpop" :
	Log10 transformation of "Deaths_per_1Mpop"

"Insolation_Average" :
	Insolation average (solar irradiance at ground level),
	in that particular month / country. 
	It is expressed in Watt / square meter of the ground surface. 
	Data derived from data avaialble at NASA Langley Research Center, NASA’s Earth Observatory, 
	CERES / FLASHFlux team, 2020, 
	https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=CERES_INSOL_M

"Cloud_Fraction" :
	Cloudiness (also known as cloud fraction, cloud cover, cloud amount or sky cover),
	as decimal fraction of the sky obscured by clouds, 
	in that particular month / country. 
	Data derived from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA’s Earth Observatory,
	MODIS Atmosphere Science Team, 2020, 
	https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MODAL2_M_CLD_FR 

"CENTR_latitude" and
"CENTR_longitude" :
	Latitude and Longitude of the country centroid, for each country. 
	Data derived from Google LLC, "Dataset publishing language: country centroids",
